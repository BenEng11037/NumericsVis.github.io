### Numerical Method Visualizer

Currently In Progress. 

The goal of this project is to help people visualize how explicit methods work for numerical integration. I got the idea from sorting algorithm visualizers and decided to apply it to a topic I really like. (This is also my first project in JS, so there's that.)

The library I am using is math.js, available at [math.js.org](https://mathjs.org/download.html). I use it to parse string expressions. If math.js is too heavy, you can easily use the [math-expression-parser](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs-expression-parser), a subset of math.js, to do the same.

# To-Do 

- [ ] Euler Method
- [ ] Improved Euler (Heun)
- [ ] Runge - Kutta
- [ ] Gaussian quadrature
- [ ] Export results to CSV
- [ ] Numeridcal Differentiation
